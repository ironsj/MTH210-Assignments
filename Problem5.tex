\begin{proposition}
Suppose $a$ and $b$ are integers. If $a$ is even and $b$ is odd, then 4 does not divide $a^3+b^3$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We will use a logically equivalent statement to prove this statement true. That is, we will assume 4 divides $a^3+b^3$ and $a$ is even, and we will prove that $b$ is even.

\newpar
Since 4 divides $a^3+b^3$, there exists an integer, $m$, such that:
\begin{align}
4m=a^3+b^3. \label{eq:1} \\
\nonumber \end{align}
\noindent Also, since $a$ is even, there exists an integer, $n$, such that:
\begin{align}
a=2n. \label{eq:2}
\end{align}

\newpar
Rearranging equation (\ref{eq:1}), substituting in equation (\ref{eq:2}), and using algebra, we obtain the following:
\begin{align*}
b^3&=4m-a^3 \\
&=4m-(2n)^3 \\
&=4m-8n^3 \\
&=2(2m-4n^3). \\
\end{align*}

\newpar We will label $k=2m-4n^3$. Because 2, 4, $m$, and $n$ are integers and the set of integers is closed under subtraction and multiplication, we know that $k$ is also an integer. Since $b^3=2k$ and $k$ is an integer, we know $b^3$ is even by the definition of even. Thus, because $b^3$ is even, we know $b$ is even by the third problem of the Indirect Proofs assignment.
\end{proof}
